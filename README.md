## Depth-First search Algorith is used to figure out list of trip
- Create a directed graph where each trip is an edge from the **from** node to the **to** node(in code).-
- For each pickup point, check if there is a valid path to any of the drop points using **Depth-First Search** (DFS).
- Intermediate warehouses are used as via points. The code ensures that if a warehouse is used, it eventually leads to a drop point.
